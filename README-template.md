## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](/images/screenshot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

- It took me about few days to build this. i started with the layout, added all classes and all sections
- Then i started adding CSS from up to down.
- lastly i imported the necessary fonts and used responsively app to test it on variuos screen.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned
- I learnt new stuffs; i learnt more about when tou use flex and grid(though i used css flexbox for this project)
- I learnt new code snippets like the 

                  * <object></object> for svgs and images 
                 *  ```place-content in css for position items
                  * Flex-wrap and flex gap.




If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

I want to continus improving in my knowlege of layouts{ GRIDS AND FLEXBOX}, positioning and writing neat code.
