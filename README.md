## My process

- It took me about few days to build this. i started with the layout, added all classes and all sections
- Then i started adding CSS from up to down.
- lastly i imported the necessary fonts and used responsively app to test it on variuos screen.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned
- I learnt new stuffs; i learnt more about when tou use flex and grid(though i used css flexbox for this project)
- I learnt new code snippets like the 

                   <object></object> for svgs and images 
                   ```place-content in css for position items
                   Flex-wrap and flex gap.
